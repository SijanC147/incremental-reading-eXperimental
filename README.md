# IR3X (_Incremental Reading 3 eXperimental_) for Anki 2.0 

**Note:** This is an experimental version of the original Incremental Reading for Anki add-on in an effort to bring some of the features of v4 of that add-on to Anki 2.0, and some others. It is in no way affiliated with that project other than being built on top of it. All issues and bugs for this add-on should be reported on this repo.
